1) /GWBW_amplicon_raw_data/ holds the raw data for the test amplicon sequencing approach.
   
2) amplicon_sequencing_methods_GWBW_GIT.sh has the full scripts for the analyses from raw data to alignment to genotypes.

3) amplicon_reference_4a_20_24_25_z1_z2.fasta is the aritificial scaffold of the six plumage regions used for alignment.
   
4) amplicon_sites.bed is the file used to force GATK to call SNPs at the specified sites.

5) raw_genotypes.txt is the resulting text file from the output of the analysis for the genotypes for the 8 birds across the 6 sites.
